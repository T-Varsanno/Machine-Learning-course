# ML Practice with Sklearn

This repository contains my practice files for machine learning using sklearn, created in Google Colab. It includes notebooks demonstrating different machine learning techniques and models.

## Contents

1. **[Regression Model Comparison](regression_model_comparison.ipynb)**:
   - **Introduction**: Explanation of the regression problem being addressed.
   - **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Detailed steps to load and preprocess the dataset.
   - **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training and evaluating multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - **Results and Conclusion**: Summarizing the results and identifying the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

2. **[Classification Model Comparison](classification_model_comparison.ipynb)**:
   - **Introduction**: Explanation of the classification problem being addressed.
   - **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Detailed steps to load and preprocess the dataset.
   - **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training and evaluating multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
   - **Results and Conclusion**: Summarizing the results and identifying the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
